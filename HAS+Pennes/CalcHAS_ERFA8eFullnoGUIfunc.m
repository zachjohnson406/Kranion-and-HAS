 % Main calculation program for Hybrid Angular Spectrum HASgui8, which uses generalized ERFA for a phased%   array.  It is assumed the the gui has already loaded the ERFA_ file, which concurrently loads the%   pressure on the ERFA plane (perfa) and the transducer parameters freq (fMHz), radius of curvature (R), %	size of the ERFA plane (Len), radiated power (Pr), distance between the xducer and ERFA plane (sx),%   and location file of the elements (ElemLoc).  Generalized ERFA first combines the element%	responses with the correct phases for focusing, then propagates to the front plane of the Modl in the%	freq domain.  Interpolation matches the points on the propagated perfa with the points on the Modl.%   In addition, the paramHAS7_ file, which reads in the Modl sample spacings and media properties, and %   the Modl_ file of media integers have also been loaded, in that order.%%   This script is executed in the main workspace, so all variables there are accessable.% %   HASgui7 has warnings that display when the sample spacing in the propagated perfa pattern is greater than%	twice (later 1x) the sample spacing in the Modl (perhaps affecting the accuracy of interp2), and when%	the size of the perfa pattern is not large enough to cover the Modl front plane when it is offset from the%   xducer axis (although this is redundant with interp2 and is now commented out).%%  This version also restructures the HAS section to improve the algorithm (see Notes of 7/7/09 and%   7/14/09), including adding the backward (only) reflected wave, weighting M2 by the expected%   beam region, and implementing an optional low pass filter on the angular spectrum to cut off evanescent%   waves.%%   Changes:%   1/27/11 - Made most of the large arrays and matrices single precision to save memory (perfa was already%       single, and Modl was already int8 [later int16 for HU of bone]).%   12/28/12 - Version CalcHAS_ERFA6c: Added absorption [requiring aabs(i) coefficients] and scattering [both%       Approach B for scatterers smaller than a voxel, and statistical Approach C for scatterers on a scale  %       larger than several voxels, requiring correlation length corrl and randvc(i)]. Assumed that the %       pressure full att coeff a = aabs + scatt.  Q calculation now based on abs coeff aabs only. %       Also added maxpoutnorm to allow modification of display normalization (later dropped), and%       corrected waitbarorig calls.%   2/16/13 - Changed interp2 to phasor_interp2 to improve interpolation of complex erfa values.%   2/18/13 - Bypassed the random number generation in the scattering sections in cases where there%       is no scattering (either max(a - aabs)=0 and/or max(randvc)=0).%   4/11/13 - Changed warning on erfa spacing to be more stringent: erfa spacing should be <= 1x model spacing.%   4/23/13 - Dropped adj. maxpoutnorm and maxQnorm capability in HASgui. Now done with colormapeditor.%   4/24/13 - Changed the way that single precision is done in the memory preallocation section.%   5/19/15 - Changed call to displa7 (ARFI displacements wdisp added).  Also cleared wdisp for new calculation.%   5/3/16 - Reduced several model parameter files (e.g., attmodl) to 2D matrices to save memory.  Also corrected%       the one-layer-off mistake (Rn->Rn+1) in backward wave (see Working Notes2, 7/7/09, revised 4/29/16).%   7/20/16 - Major change: Now use full integration of excess propagation constant for propagation in the space%       domain rather than the approximation employed in earlier versions of CalcHAS. (Versions CalcHAS_ERFA7b %       and HASgui7b have the option to chose the approx or not.) The full integration is slighty slower due to a 'for'%       loop (depending upon number of media types) but is more accurate for models with small voxels %       (thus large alpha and beta) and/or largely variable speeds of sound or attenuation. %       (see Working Notes2, 7/7/09, revised 4/29/16). %       Also, statistical scattering by Approach C is now used only to vary the pprimeterm in the full integration%       step, not to vary each individual parameter (i.e., a, c and rho).%%   3/5/17 - This version does NOT have the "anti-leakage" sections used for microparticles.%          The waitbar is also made to be the MATLAB default.%   3/10/17 - Multiple reflections added. See the sheets entitled "Latest Diagram of Progression of Pressure in %       CalcHAS" 3/10/17 and "Stategy for Multiple Reflections" 3/10/17 to get an overview of the layout for multiple %       reflections. It uses the variable numrefl from the gui. To get ready for multiple reflections, the variable pforb%       was added, to be symmetrical with pbackb; pforb is also now used as the beam profile weighting of bprime.  %   5/5/17 - Optional plots of the beam power profiles at each loop added.%   1/12/2019 - Changed call in line 93 to SteeringPhasesPA8, which switches sign of h to -h to account for the%       opposite direction of x-axis in HAS (LHS) compared to the original development of the steering equations.%   5/15/2019 - Bypassed calculation of transferfa if emdist (distance to move front pattern) is zero.%   6/14/2019 - Added the capability of implementing phase correction based on: %       1. Checkbox7 (loads a 4D variable called PhCorr1 from a file obtained earlier with the script %            PhCorrMethod1_UsingCalcHAS.m) or%       2. Checkbox8 (calls script PhCorrMethod2_UsingTimeRev.m, which propagates beam back to transducer) or%       3. Checkbox9 (calls script PhCorrMethod3_UsingRayTrace.m, which finds phase along ray to each element.%       They all assume the intended focal location is given by the (possibly steered) focal location found in the gui %       and override the phases found for electronic steering alone.%   7/18/19 - Added tests when PhCorrMethod1 is implemented to make sure the configuration when PhCorr1 was%       calculated matches the current configuration, and checks whether the current focus is inside the ROI. The%       PhCorr1 array must be generated with the program 'PhCorrMethod1_UsingPreCalcHAS1' or later versions.%   04/20/2020, Michelle Kline, %       added ability to run this script from either HAS_NoGUI.m or from the interface.%       used variable usingGUI, which is either set in HAS_NoGUI.m, or initializegui7.m%   04/23/2020, Michelle Kline and D.A.
